# Grades-Module-Unit-Testing
This project implements unit tests using Python's unittest module to validate the functionality of a Grades module. It tests functions like total, average, and median to ensure they behave as expected. The tests cover normal cases, edge cases (such as empty lists), and checks for mathematical precision
